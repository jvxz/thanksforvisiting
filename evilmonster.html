                    <p class="text-justify"> Once upon a time there was an ugly man. He lived in caves. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify"> He was half man and half monster and he ate gorillas for food when he was
                        hungry. When he was 3 he was very nice but
                        when he turned 12 he turned into a monster! His name is the purple cave man monster. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        But he was also an alien and his home planet was called ookpop. He has a rocket ship and it can
                        go 9,000,000 miles a
                        day. He went to earth Thursday in 1983. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify"> He landed in a lake inside forests and his ship sank. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify"> He was on earth now and needed to survive. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify"> He saw a man named the president! The president fainted. He was under a
                        spell! </p>
                    <p class="text-justify"> Before he was fully under the spell he whispered to purple cave man monster
                        and told him that he was under the control
                        of a wizard. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify"> But it wasn't a wizard it was just that he was scared of purple cave man
                        monster's ship crashing in front of him. So
                        then the president got angry and for that he shot a laser at him but the president dodged it.
