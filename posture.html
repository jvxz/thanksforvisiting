    <p class="text-red"> If you want to have good posture, and everyone does, here are some helpful posture questions to
        ask yourself. </p>
    <hr>
    <p> Do I... </p>
    <p> ...sit tall with feet flat on the floor? </p>
    <p> ...sit with my buttocks against the lower back of my chair? </p>
    <p> ...hold my head high, and keep my chin up marionette style? </p>
    <p> ...walk with my legs close together, swinging them from the hip joints? </p>
    <p> ...walk letting my heel hit the ground first, followed by the outside of my foot, then the toe? </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="text-red"> Why not check back every day and chart your own posture progress? </p>
